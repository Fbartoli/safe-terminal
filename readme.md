## Environment Variables

The application requires certain environment variables to be set. You can set them up in two ways:

### Method 1: Using a .env file (Recommended for Development)

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Method 2: Setting Environment Variables Directly

```bash
# For Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)
export WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
safe-terminal

# For Windows (PowerShell)
$env:WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
safe-terminal

# Or inline with the command
WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id safe-terminal
```

Required variables:
- `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: Your WalletConnect project ID (Get it from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/))
